Kubelet
1. Kubelet is the captain of the ship which moves the pods to the nodes. 
2. This will have the information of the pods in the nodes. It will not decide which pod goes to which node. It will be done by kube-scheduler


Kube-proxy
1. It is the component associated with pods to communicate with the service which creates the communication between 2 pods. Ex. If the app pod wants to communicate with the DB pod, there is a service which will be assigned with a IP address. Now this service will send the info to and fro to the app & db pod through kube-proxy.
